# GraphQL Chat Application with Subscriptions

This GraphQL Chat Application leverages the power of GraphQL Subscriptions to create a real-time chat experience. Subscriptions in GraphQL are a way to push data from the server to the clients that choose to listen to real-time messages. Unlike queries and mutations, the implementation of subscriptions is left up to the developer, often utilizing WebSockets.

## Features

- Real-time messaging between users
- Subscription to message channels
- Creation of message channels
- Apollo Server for advanced GraphQL server capabilities

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed the latest version of:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Installation

Start by cloning the repository and installing the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
npm install
```

This project depends on the following main packages:
- `apollo-server` for GraphQL server implementation
- `graphql` for defining schemas and resolvers

## Setting Up the Server

To set up the server, follow these steps:

1. **Start a new npm project:**

```bash
npm init -y
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install apollo-server@2 graphql
```

3. **Set up your server:**

Create a `server.js` file in the root of your project:

```bash
touch server.js
```

4. **Add a start script to `package.json`:**

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "nodemon server.js"
}
```

## Running the Server

To run the server, execute:

```bash
npm start
```

Your server will start, and you can access the Apollo Server playground at the printed URL, typically `http://localhost:4000`.

## Testing Your Application

To test the real-time chat functionality, you can use the Apollo Server playground. This interface allows you to test queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

1. **Query for existing posts**
2. **Subscribe to new posts**
3. **Mutate by adding a new post**
4. **Create and subscribe to new message channels**

Refer to the GraphQL documentation and Apollo Server docs for more details on how to structure these requests.

## Challenges and Extensions

This application sets a foundation for a real-time chat service. Here are some challenges to extend its functionality:

1. **Manage Channels:** Implement functionality to create, list, and manage chat channels.
2. **Channel Queries:** Add queries to fetch messages from specific channels.
3. **AddChannel Mutation:** Allow users to create new message channels.
4. **NewChannel Subscription:** Enable subscriptions to be notified when new channels are created.
5. **Associate Posts with Channels:** Modify the data model to associate posts with specific channels.
6. **Test Your Implementation:** Use the Apollo Server playground to test your queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
